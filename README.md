AndroidKeyStore is a library for Android apps that allows you to encrypt sensitive information, The encryption uses the Android KeyStore available to generate and uses RSA and AES keys for encryption operations.

## Adding androidkeystore to your project

Include the following dependencies in your app's build.gradle :

```
dependencies {
    implementation 'com.mutualmobile:androidkeystore:0.0.4'
}
```

## How to use

1. Get an instance of KeystoreCryptoFactory

``` java
val factory = KeystoreCryptoFactory.get(context)
```

2. Now carry out the encryption/decryption

**NOTE:** Since the Encryption/Decryption is Async, the following tasks needs to be done on a background thread

``` java
  //Generate Key Aliases
  factory.create_key_if_not_available(EMAIL)
  factory.create_key_if_not_available(PASSWORD)

  //Encrypt the string
  val encryptedEmail = factory.encrypt(EMAIL, mEmail)
  val encryptedPassword = factory.encrypt(PASSWORD, mPassword)

  //Decrypt the string
  factory.decrypt(EMAIL, encryptedEmail)
  factory.decrypt(PASSWORD, encryptedPassword)
```
